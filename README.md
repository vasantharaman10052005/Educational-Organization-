# Educational-Organization-Management Using ServiceNow

## âœ… Project Overview
This project is designed to automate student admission and progress tracking for educational institutions using *ServiceNow*.  
It helps in managing student details, academic records, and results by creating structured forms, tables, and client-side scripts that simplify data entry and calculations.

## ðŸ“‚ Tables Created
1. *Educational Organisation* â€“ Stores general student information like admin number, name, contact details, etc.
2. *Admission* â€“ Used for recording enrollment details of students such as grade, guardian information, and more.
3. *Student Progress* â€“ Tracks marks, calculates total scores, percentage, and final result.
